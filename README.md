# Decentralized Lottery System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Lottery System is a blockchain-based lottery platform built on Ethereum that ensures complete transparency, fairness, and security. Unlike traditional lotteries controlled by centralized authorities, this system operates entirely on smart contracts, making it trustless and verifiable by anyone.

Players can purchase lottery tickets using ETH, and winners are selected through Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF), ensuring true randomness that cannot be manipulated. The system automatically distributes prizes and starts new lottery rounds, creating a continuous, fair gaming experience.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the lottery industry by:

- **Eliminating Trust Issues**: Removing the need to trust centralized lottery operators
- **Ensuring Fair Play**: Using cryptographically secure randomness for winner selection
- **Providing Transparency**: All transactions and outcomes are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Supporting Social Causes**: Integrating charitable donations into the prize distribution mechanism
- **Creating Global Access**: Enabling anyone worldwide to participate without geographical restrictions

We aim to build the most trusted and transparent lottery platform that serves as a model for decentralized gambling applications.
